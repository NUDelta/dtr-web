      <h2>Design, Technology, and Research (DTR)</h2>

      <p>
        In DTR, we develop systems that shape new experiences with people and
        technology. We are designers, builders, and researchers. We are
        undergrads, grads, and faculty. We are a community who support one
        another, work hard together, learn together, laugh together, have a
        good time together, struggle together. We design solutions to address
        peopleâ€™s needs, explore new technologies that capture our imagination,
        and challenge ourselves to advance the state of the art through
        research.
