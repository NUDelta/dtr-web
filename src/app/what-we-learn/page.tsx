        What Students Get Out of DTR
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-6">
        In 2021 we sought out letters from DTR students and alums, asking
        them to share what they got from their DTR experience. We received
        about 30 letters, and the studentsâ€™ words provide a much better
        picture of DTR than our website did. We share some excerpts from
        these letters below.

        In these ways, DTR provides a spectacular learning space for
        students. We will work hard to keep it that way. As long as DTR
        continues to do right by students, we will do just fine.
