Everything worked client-side, so the cost to us was minimal.\n\nThe project was a huge challenge because we were trying to build a business without having any money or resources.

As he pointed out, I wasn’t designing with purpose. A layout is not just a bunch of pretty elements; instead, the content needs to drive the design. Each element should have a purpose that connects to the spreads overall message, from the the dominant picture and headline to story and sidebars. They all need to work together to communicate one idea.\n\nWhen I took my first programming class, I was surprised to realize the same principles of design still applied even in a technical setting. Learning to write Java, I found myself comparing strategies with classmates, endeavoring to make my code as concise as possible. The main run method had to be effectively supported by other sub-methods and work together to make the program run. But it wasn’t enough for the program to work, others should be able to effortlessly read my code and understand the purpose and order of each line.\n \nDesign has become a lens through which I view my world. My critical eye is always attuned, evaluating the good and the bad design elements. While watching college information presentations, I notice the difference between the PowerPoint that has Comic Sans slapped on top of a photo and the video that uses the movement of the film to seamlessly transition between scenes. When a math problem goes up on the board I appreciate how a classmate’s work flows and clearly explains his or her work.

I was brought on the team to refactor the website and add some new features.

However, by the time their operations began, I had finished my work, and seeing the immediate benefits in production was very satisfying.",

My team went from beacon broad casting, designing a poster stand along Sheridan, to our final design of the chalk spray stencil. During our user testings we learnt a lot about how people usually  get information for campus events and react to flyers. \n\nNow the chalk spray stencil idea is already implemented, for example the \"EPIC\" and \"Cru+\" ads on Sheridan.

I want to improve my hacking/building skills, particularly in mobile, web, and wearable development. I really want more hands-on experience with fully fleshing out an idea over a quarter or two.

        "projectstory": "For Tangible Interaction Design and Learning, my group decided to build a tangible system that would teach people how to bartend (make standard drink recipes). We came up with a bartending piano. It was a system with seven water dispensers lined up next to each other, each of which represented an ingredient and had an assigned note on the C scale. Then the system would play a sequence of notes representing a drink recipe that the user then had to replicate the note sequence by pouring out of the right dispenser for the right amount of time. It was exciting because our group liked the combination between drink-making and music-making. Also I really liked it because I got to work with hardware for the first time, getting the chance to play with Arduinos and sensors. This was challenging because I knew next to nothing about electronics, wiring, sensors, soldering, etc. By the end, I became my team's wiring expert fully in charge of our system's hardware because I liked it so much.
