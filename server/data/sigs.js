	"about": "Breaking Boundaries focuses on exploring novel interactions and connecting people in unusual ways. Each project examines nuances in the specific ways people choose to act or work and seeks to expand the value of what they do or share. Remote Paper Prototype Testing, or RPPT, approaches lo-fidelity prototyping differently. Traditional advances in prototyping or design methods lean toward quickly developing more complex and fleshed out demos, which often means creating many predefined interactions for designers to customize and insert. RPPT instead focuses on making low fidelity paper prototyping, which has no such restrictions, more accessible, powerful, and able to be conducted remotely. Through \“Big Talk,\” Kalina is developing an interactive video platform that invites users across the world to engage in deep and meaningful discussion. Big Talk seeks to promote global interconnectedness across boundaries of space, ideology, and external perceived differences through the sharing of universal ideas constituting the collective human experience. Secrets connects strangers through sharing of secret information about their community. Performance of a user-specified task is exchanged for one of these secrets. The tasks establish reciprocity and trust between users, which creates and strengthens community between strangers.",

	"about" : "After completing programming courses, students encounter barriers when trying to contribute to open source and professional projects. Students may have the knowledge to develop an application, but a small gap such as knowing which tool is the right tool to use can keep a student from applying their skills where a need exists. We propose research to bridge gaps in knowledge and overcome lack-of-experience barriers with a two-prong approach: Programming with a Purpose (PWAP) and Readily Available Learning Experiences (RALE). The PWAP initiative provides students with an opportunity to learn production-quality development practices while fulfilling the coding needs of actual clients. RALEs help students and professionals to overcome knowledge gaps that prevent them from developing high quality software products. Through participation in PWAP and RALEs, we hypothesize that students can gain tangible project experience and eliminate barriers to production-quality development.",
