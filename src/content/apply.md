# Apply

> Interested in joining us? Follow the steps below:

1. Learn more about DTR by [browsing this website](/), [reading the agile research paper](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq/papers/ars-cscw2017.pdf), or [watching the documentary](https://www.forward.movie/).

2. Complete the [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12PJFFoPrk6CzopB0mAm2Go3eLFBzNMMmwjDtCNAdKEc/viewform) to tell us more about you and when you can meet with us. You should apply in the quarter _prior_ to the one in which you want to join DTR (for example, to join in Spring quarter, apply during the preceding Winter quarter). Applications should be submitted within a few days of the quarterly DTR Open House (usually in the middle of the quarter), or by week 5–6 of the current quarter. Applications received after this will be reviewed as part of the next quarter’s cycle.

3. We will contact selected candidates for an interview within about a week. We look for students who are exceptional in their design, technical, and/or research abilities. This may be evidenced through classes you have taken, projects you have led or contributed to, and your personal growth.

4. During the one-hour interview, you will meet with two student teams and one faculty mentor. The meeting gives you an opportunity to learn more about the program, the people, and the projects, and gives us a sense of your design skills, technical abilities, and “research feel.”

5. We will select candidates to join DTR based on expertise, growth potential, and fit. After decisions are made, we schedule follow-up meetings to brainstorm and define a research direction before the next quarter starts.

We take the process of selecting and training students seriously. Most DTR students continue until they graduate (by choice!). Our goal is to foster an evolving community of dedicated, curious students who are excited to learn and grow together.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to [Haoqi](mailto:hq@northwestern.edu) or [anyone else in DTR](/people).
