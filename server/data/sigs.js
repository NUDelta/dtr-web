        "about": "Breaking Boundaries focuses on exploring novel interactions and connecting people in unusual ways. Each project examines nuances in the specific ways people choose to act or work and seeks to expand the value of what they do or share. Remote Paper Prototype Testing, or RPPT, approaches lo-fidelity prototyping differently. Traditional advances in prototyping or design methods lean toward quickly developing more complex and fleshed out demos, which often means creating many predefined interactions for designers to customize and insert. RPPT instead focuses on making low fidelity paper prototyping, which has no such restrictions, more accessible, powerful, and able to be conducted remotely. Through \“Big Talk,\” Kalina is developing an interactive video platform that invites users across the world to engage in deep and meaningful discussion. Big Talk seeks to promote global interconnectedness across boundaries of space, ideology, and external perceived differences through the sharing of universal ideas constituting the collective human experience. Secrets connects strangers through sharing of secret information about their community. Performance of a user-specified task is exchanged for one of these secrets. The tasks establish reciprocity and trust between users, which creates and strengthens community between strangers.",

        "about": "After completing programming courses, students encounter barriers when trying to contribute to open source and professional projects. Students may have the knowledge to develop an application, but a small gap such as knowing which tool is the right tool to use can keep a student from applying their skills where a need exists. We propose research to bridge gaps in knowledge and overcome lack-of-experience barriers with a two-prong approach: Programming with a Purpose (PWAP) and Readily Available Learning Experiences (RALE). The PWAP initiative provides students with an opportunity to learn production-quality development practices while fulfilling the coding needs of actual clients. RALEs help students and professionals to overcome knowledge gaps that prevent them from developing high quality software products. Through participation in PWAP and RALEs, we hypothesize that students can gain tangible project experience and eliminate barriers to production-quality development.",

The SIG currently focuses on enhancing situational human experiences that involve exercise. In particular, we will be focusing on two different projects - one involving the crowdsourcing of a group of people to motivate an individual while they are exercising, and one involving the crowdsourcing of a group of spectators at a hockey game to help coaches understand trends in their players and the live game. Both projects will seek to discover how connecting people indirectly involved with an exercise helps those actually performing the exercise or playing in the game.",

        "about": "The On-the-Go Crowdsourcing SIG will focus on designing, developing, and deploying mobile applications that aim to engage individuals in physical crowdsourcing efforts and related tasks. Projects are designed within the constraint of peoples’ existing mobility and routines in order to either contribute to data collection and tracking efforts or to complete physical tasks. TapShare and Gaze focus on using lightweight interactions and natural gestures to create and scaffold location-based reports. Technologies such as tap detection and architecture for an identify-focus-capture technique are primary components of TapShare and Gaze. CrowdFound and Libero support communities who help each other look for lost items and deliver packages through their daily routines. CrowdFound and Libero primarily use context detection (motion activity, direction, time of day, distance, geofencing, and iBeacon technology) to create context-aware and highly specific location-based notifications. All projects are iOS applications that use location-based notifications either to scaffold existing data (i.e. contributing reports to applications built using TapShare and Gaze) or to prompt users to complete a task (i.e. use Libero to pick up packages from the mailroom to deliver to a fellow student in the same dorm).",
