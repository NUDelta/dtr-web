	"about" : "Throughout the world, millions of people walk, bike, and run the same routes at the same time, every day. This patterned, collective effort represents a potentially valuable yet underutilized resource for sensing, transporting goods, or completing small tasks that advance individual and societal goals. In this paper, we introduce a system called Libero, which utilizes people’s existing routine for package delivery by incorporating just-in-time notifications in hopes of reducing task distance to an extreme (50 meters) and having a community support itself in doing simple tasks for one another. The results of preliminary studies show that just-in-time notifications helped promoting delivery, but other factors, such as reciprocity, community building, and social obligation were also important drivers for promoting participation.",

	"about" : "CrowdFound, a mobile crowdsourcing system to find lost items. CrowdFound allows users to input lost item descriptions on a map and then sends notifications to users passing near tagged areas. To assess the system’s efficacy, we conducted interviews and user testing on CrowdFound. Our results show that users were able to find lost items when using a combination of the notification, map, and item description features. In addition, users were willing to deviate off path to look for lost items, particularly when exercising.  Our findings also suggest socio-technical features to promote more effective on-the-go crowdsourced help on microtasks. This research builds our understanding of physical crowdsourcing as a tool for solving societal problems and suggests broader implications for utilizing mobile crowds",

	"about" : "Information sharing a core focus of many online systems, and within these systems information is shared either through established social ties and networks or to the general public. However, there are opportunities to share types of information that are not shared in these systems because they are too public. These types of information would benefit from the ability to be shared in controlled non-public manners due to their limited or private nature. We introduce Secrets, a system that allows users to specify limits on who information in shared with, in this case with user-specified tasks. These tasks establish communication channels between users and create common identity or reciprocity to promote information sharing. This paper will discuss the design of Secrets and present results from a 1-week deployment through a college community where users performed tasks and shared secrets about their community. The results found from this deployment show that user-imposed tasks promote information sharing and that information shared over this platform differs from information shared to the public or to existing networks",

Traditional advances in prototyping or design methods lean toward quickly developing more complex and fleshed out demos, which often means creating many predefined interactions for designers to customize and insert.

	"about" : "Youth and high school hockey coaches want to be able to show their players game film in order to teach them how to improve their skills, technique, and game decisions. This is difficult for the coach because reviewing game film takes a great deal of time. What if parents were to give coaches the times of these important events through an iOS app, so the coach already knows what to review and can perform the film review faster so the players have more opportunities to learn off the ice? I’ve designed, built, and user tested an iOS app that allows multiple parents in the stands to record game events in real time, with the timestamp of these recordings being manually sent to the coach for review. I’ve found so far that it will most likely take an entire crowd of parents at a game to get accurate recordings that will earn the confidence of the coach, and I’m currently exploring real-time crowdsourcing techniques to arrive at a solution which utilizes all parents in the stands",
