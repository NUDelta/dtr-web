        <h3>Design, Technology, and Research (DTR)</h3>
        <p>At DTR, we develop systems that shape new experiences with people and technology. We are designers, builders, and researchers. We are undergrads, grads, and faculty. We are a community who support one another, work hard together, learn together, laugh together, have a good time together, struggle together. We design solutions to address peopleâ€™s needs, explore new technologies that capture our imagination, and challenge ourselves to advance the state of the art through research.</p>
