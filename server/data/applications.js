Everything worked client-side, so the cost to us was minimal.\n\nThe project was a huge challenge because we were trying to build a business without having any money or resources.

As he pointed out, I wasn’t designing with purpose. A layout is not just a bunch of pretty elements; instead, the content needs to drive the design. Each element should have a purpose that connects to the spreads overall message, from the the dominant picture and headline to story and sidebars. They all need to work together to communicate one idea.\n\nWhen I took my first programming class, I was surprised to realize the same principles of design still applied even in a technical setting. Learning to write Java, I found myself comparing strategies with classmates, endeavoring to make my code as concise as possible. The main run method had to be effectively supported by other sub-methods and work together to make the program run. But it wasn’t enough for the program to work, others should be able to effortlessly read my code and understand the purpose and order of each line.\n \nDesign has become a lens through which I view my world. My critical eye is always attuned, evaluating the good and the bad design elements. While watching college information presentations, I notice the difference between the PowerPoint that has Comic Sans slapped on top of a photo and the video that uses the movement of the film to seamlessly transition between scenes. When a math problem goes up on the board I appreciate how a classmate’s work flows and clearly explains his or her work.

Take, for example, some data about what a person has eaten and their mood throughout the day. We all have foods that make us happy and some that we tend to avoid. We learn these distinctions over time, but will often miss the specific cause of why we do or don’t like something (e.g. not liking fried rice but actually not enjoying baby corn in the rice). Instead of this repeated retrospection on why a food is not enjoyable, we can use data to narrow the real cause down from an entire dish to a small set of ingredients.

This meant that we would not have time to pick the best features or stratification of users in our data. To address this, I learned how to quickly eliminate unusable features and select, by intuition, which features seem viable. This gave more time to experiment with various machine learning models and, in the end, find a relationship between demographics and how planned a shopping trip may have been.

But I am learning a lot about psychology on top of visualization, and I just recently attended the VIS conference (in Chicago this year!) and finally got to meet my collaborator at Tableau who is about as big as you can get in the field of information visualization, so I'm always grateful that the lab offered me to be a part of this awesome project.",

        "whydtr": "I think that DTR will expand my mind towards more understanding about design with technology, and thinking about design and technology together rather than as disparate and separate portions of the process. I think that in order to be as ethical as possible with the technology that we (me) as engineers create, we need to be able to have a sense of analyzing our ideas with the principle of design – what are the extended outcomes, how does this make people feel, etc. We also need to understand how to alter our decisions for the human factors that come into play. \n\nOne good example of this is what League of Legends has done about dealing with harassment issues. Small changes in the engineering and system design can help make the experience of using this platform more inclusive and fun for everyone. I'm not a LoL player, but I think this is a really way that technology can so directly influence the experience of real people. ",

As in, you just click on whatever you want to change, on _any_ website, and you can change it, in place, without disturbing the existing design or anything. Better than a template or drag-n-drop interface, it's a practically nonexistent layer on top of what is essentially already a full-featured interactive environment: your website.",
        "csexperience": "Well, I guess the above answer applies here too. When it comes to web technology, I have worked for some place or another as a professional web developer ever since I came to Northwestern as a freshman. Concerning mobile, I have been really closely following Apache Cordova, especially with the release of Intel Crosswalk - it looks like web apps are about to be back in style, and I really think that's the ultimate future for mobile. I mean, nobody likes downloading and installing apps - and the web is literally the world's largest, most accessible, and most powerful run-anywhere operating system, with batteries (apps) included! Just download what you want on the fly, and cache anything you want when you're in airplane mode. Firefox OS has the right idea, but I don't think they're going to be very successful. The next iteration of Android is moving in the right direction (according to that talk at Google I/O), and I'm excited to see the mobile world become truly mobile - and truly connected - instead of some legacy amalgam of cellular features with the internet patched in with a hack and a webview. The future of mobile is embracing the internet, not hacking around it.",

        "passions": "Computer Science. Its community. Open Source.\n\nNodeJS and JavaScript, for better or for worse.\n\nI'm an avid Clojure enthusiast, and I've really been meaning to read Paul Graham's Lisp book. I find it... easy to put down.\n\nI spend a lot of time reading Github, EchoJS, and Hacker News streams. More than I'd really like to admit.\n\nI recently published my first (useful) library, and actual people have actually starred it on GitHub and used it (!). (github.com/skorlir/gulp-load-subtasks)\n\nI'm passionate about building abstractions that make powerful concepts approachable and useful. I'm fascinated by higher-level programming languages that are foreign to most programmers like Clojure and Haskell. I enjoy designing interfaces and APIs, and I have a job at the WCAS Multimedia Learning Center (MMLC) doing exactly that. I also work on a lot of independent pet projects, in addition to spending a lot of time writing technology for the student group I am now Co-President of, EPIC (Entrepreneurs, Pioneers, Innovators, Creators, nuisepic.com | github.com/nuisepic).\n\nAt EPIC, we tend to favor quick development time over experimentation and new technology, so we usually use Angular, MongoDB/Mongoose, and Express/Nodejs for everything (A MEAN stack, except we use Apache). In my personal projects I like to branch out and try rewriting popular libraries myself, mostly for the sake of learning how they work. Over time, I've outgrown my need to use jQuery for anything, and typically don't include it in my projects. When I need something specific, like a selector engine, I usually reach for Sizzle or Qwery. When I need AJAX, I look to qwest, or xhr2, or axios. When I need utility functions, I look to lodash or underscore. With a greater familiarity regarding the JavaScript ecosystem, I have become focused on minimizing the number of libraries and the lines of code taken up by my projects, and it usually ends up producing leaner and (in my opinion) clearer, and just as easily understood code. I used to obsess over minimizing line count, but over time I've outgrown that and become focused on minimizing development work and maximizing reusability instead. I want to live up to the title of software engineer, rather than merely being a \"programmer\" or a \"hacker.\" I want to build it really well, or not at all.\n\nFollowing my passion for abstractions, I've been experimenting with composition and class structures in JavaScript, trying to find a \"better way\" than the buggy and confusing protoypal/classical hybrid system that JavaScript can't seem to get quite right. (See `this` for an example of a frustrating JavaScript class \"feature.\") The result of that experimentation is an in-development library called \"Classy\" (github.com/mmlc/classy) that I've been working on at the MMLC as a part of a larger software system for creating and managing spoken exam problems for language students. That project is called AudIt, and sadly is not open source. (It's planned to make its first public appearance in Northwestern language placement exams next Fall.) Anyway; Classy is a compositional class constructor that emphasizes minimalism and extensibility over feature curation. It eschews prototypes and classical inheritance patterns, and every feature of Classy has to be added in as a plugin before it will appear in Classy Classes or on Instances. It's about 100 LOC, not counting comments or \"classy core\" plugins (which are just IsInstance, ToString, and Compose). It was my goal to have a small, comprehensible codebase.\n\nSo far as interfaces go, I've worked professionally as a web designer on multiple occasions.  Sometimes I design well (fiddlenaut.com), sometimes I design things that are just ok (roadrunnercomputers.com), but usually I can approximate a good design long enough someone who is actually a designer can correct things without the ship sinking first.",
        "fun": "Huh. Functors? Monoids? I've been researching Haskell. I've skimmed Learn You A Haskell again, and I slowly build up more knowledge over time.\n\nI guess the most recent thing I've sat down and learned would probably be Elm, but I didn't get very far before realizing it's basically a poor man's watered-down version of Haskell. Especially since it has that massive runtime. I don't much like runtimes; at least, not large ones.\n\nOh, I think it was Elixir. I think Elixir is a pretty cool little web language, and I want to try and use Phoenix in a project sometime. It would have to be something that lends itself to highly distributed work - like a big, realtime chat engine or something.",
        "projectstory": "Classy. Definitely Classy. See above.\n\nI'm about to take on a redesign of iStart (iStart.org) for the next NUVC, and I think that'll be fun, although probably not very challenging. It's just a basic run-of-the-mill web app, but the NUVC team is really fun to work with, so I'm looking forward to it.",
